# Primary dataset - Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) 
- [x] This database contains clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
- [x] These interviews were collected as part of a larger effort to create a computer agent that interviews people and identifies verbal and nonverbal indicators of mental illness (DeVault et al., 2014).  
- [x] Data collected include audio and video recordings and extensive questionnaire responses; this part of the corpus includes data from the Wizard-of-Oz interviews, conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie, controlled by a human interviewer in another room.
